# INITIAL DRAFT - Thinking process or technologies

- Framework: Fastify (because it's faster more efficient, built-in validation and serialization)

- Data validation: Fastify + Zod / Fastify offers support

- ORM: TypeORM because of TypeScript

- Main Lang: TypeScript

- Tests (TDD): Jest Unit tests

- Database: Postgress: Because it's SQL and AWS RDS

- Migrations: See if TYPEORM is enough, otherwise -> Knex

- A criação das estruturas de dados "mockados": faker.js, falso or typeorm-seeding (check later)

- Docker? Necessary?
